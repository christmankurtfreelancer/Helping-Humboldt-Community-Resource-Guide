# Helping-Humboldt-Community-Resource-Guide
The idea behind this initiative is to create a centralized location where people can easily access information about local resources that can help them in times of need. By providing this information in a CSV file format, we aim to make it easy for individuals, community organizations, and businesses to access and utilize the data.
